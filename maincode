#USING CORRELATION TO FIND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE VARIABLES AFFECTING WATER QUALITY

import seaborn as sns

plt.show()

#Attributes with low correlation (close to 0) to contamination indicators are less 
#likely to influence contamination directly.

#Also, BOD shows a positive correlation with Fecal Coliform, Total Coliform, 
#and Nitrate levels, conclude that organic waste is a key contributor to microbial contamination.


#PLOTTING TO SHOW THE SPECIFIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TWO VARIABLES HAVING ANY CORRELATION

#If DO shows a strong negative correlation with contaminants like BOD or coliforms,
#it implies that contamination reduces oxygen levels, possibly due to microbial activity.

sns.relplot(x="D_O_mg_l_Mean_4_mg_l",y="B_O_D_mg_l_Mean_3_mg_l",data=data)
plt.show()

#here DO have a negative correlation with BOD which states a reduction in oxygen leading to microbial activity

#High correlation between Fecal Coliform and Total Coliform might indicate similar sources of microbial contamination.

sns.relplot(x="FECAL_COLIFORM_MPN_100ml_Mean_2500_MPN_100ml",y="TOTAL_COLIFORM_MPN_100ml_Mean_5000_MPN_100ml",data=data)
plt.show()

#this data shows a slight positive correlation between them. 

Here, we can see a moderately strong correlation between Fecal and Total Coliforms, which indicates similar sources of microbial contamination.

REPORT OF THE WATER QUALTIY PROJECT

Overall Report for the test Water quality is primarily influenced by a combination of variables, many of which are highly interrelated. Notably:

Temperature shows a strong correlation with fecal coliform and total coliform levels.

Dissolved Oxygen (D.O.) is closely linked to biochemical oxygen demand (B.O.D.).

Conductivity, pH, and nitrate values appear to have minimal influence on other variables. However, the pH value remains an important factor for assessing water quality, as it plays a neutral role in this dataset.

The overall analysis indicates that water quality is good across all states. 
Since the dataset lacks a specific dependent variable representing water quality, 
all variables contribute significantly to the assessment.
 However, it cannot be conclusively determined that any single variable alone is the definitive 
 factor affecting water quality.
